<h1>Problem B</h1>
<h2>Broken Keyboard (a.k.a. Beiju Text)</h2>
</center>

<p>You're typing a long text with a broken keyboard. Well it's not so badly broken. The only problem with the keyboard is that sometimes the "home" key or the "end" key gets automatically pressed (internally). </p>

<p>You're not aware of this issue, since you're focusing on the text and did not even turn on the monitor! After you finished typing, you can see a text on the screen (if you turn on the monitor). </p>

<p>In Chinese, we can call it Beiju. Your task is to find the Beiju text.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There are several test cases. Each test case is a single line containing at least one and at most 100,000 letters, underscores and two special characters '[' and ']'. '[' means the "Home" key is pressed internally, and ']' means the "End" key is pressed internally. The input is terminated by end-of-file (EOF). The size of input file does not exceed 5MB.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, print the Beiju text on the screen.</p>

<h2>Sample Input</h2>
<pre>
This_is_a_[Beiju]_text
[[]][][]Happy_Birthday_to_Tsinghua_University
</pre>

<h2>Output for the Sample Input</h2>
<pre>
BeijuThis_is_a__text
Happy_Birthday_to_Tsinghua_University
</pre>
