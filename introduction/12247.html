Jollo is a simple card game which the children from Logonia love to 
play. It is played between two players with a normal deck of 52 cards. 
In the game, cards are ordered according to their rank and suit, 
forming a sequence of 52 distinct values. 

<P>
The game is composed of three rounds, played in a best-of-three series 
(a player must win two rounds to win the game). At the beginning of 
the game the deck is shuffled and each player is given a hand of 
three cards. In each round the players show one card to each other 
and the player with the highest card wins the round. The cards shown 
in a round are discarded (i.e., they cannot be shown again). 

<P>
The King's son loves to play the game. But he is not very smart, 
losing frequently to his little sister. And when he loses, he cries 
so loud no one can stand it. The servant who deals the cards to the 
Prince and his sister is afraid he will be sent to prison if the 
Prince continues to lose. The servant is allowed to see every card 
he deals, and after dealing five cards (three to the Princess and 
two to the Prince) he wants to know which is the lowest card he 
should deal to the Prince so that there is no chance he will lose 
the game, no matter how badly he plays.

<P>
For each test case output a single line. If there exists a card that 
will make the Prince win the game no matter how badly he plays, you 
must print the lowest such a card. Otherwise, print <TT>-1</TT>.
