Allied Chute Manufacturers is a company that builds trash chutes. A trash chute is a 
hollow tube installed in buildings so that trash dropped in at the top will fall down 
and be collected in the basement. Designing trash chutes is actually highly nontrivial. 
Depending on what kind of trash people are expected to drop into them, the trash chute 
needs to have an appropriate size. And since the cost of manufacturing a trash chute is 
proportional to its size, the company always would like to build a chute that is as small 
as possible. Choosing the right size can be tough though.

<P>
We will consider a 2-dimensional simplification of the chute design problem. A trash 
chute points straight down and has a constant width. Objects that will be dropped into 
the trash chute are modeled as polygons. Before an object is dropped into the chute it 
can be rotated so as to provide an optimal fit. Once dropped, it will travel on a 
straight path downwards and will not rotate in flight. The following figure shows how 
an object is first rotated so it fits into the trash chute.

Your task is to compute the smallest chute width that will allow a given polygon to pass 
through.

<P>
The input contains several test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing an 
integer <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> <!-- MATH
 $(3 \le n \le 100)$

<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(3<IMG

 ALT="$ \le$">100)</SPAN>, the number of points in the polygon that models the 
trash item. 

<P>
The next <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> lines then contain pairs of integers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I><SUB>i</SUB></SPAN> <!-- MATH

y_{i} \le 10^{4})$

 ALT="$ \le$">10<SUP>4</SUP>)</SPAN>, giving the coordinates of the polygon vertices in order. 
All points in one test case are guaranteed to be mutually distinct and the polygon 
sides will never intersect. (Technically, there is one inevitable exception of two 
neighboring sides sharing their common vertex. Of course, this is not considered an 
intersection.)

<P>
The last test case is followed by a line containing a single zero.

<P>
For each test case, display its case number followed by the width of the smallest 
trash chute through which it can be dropped. Display the minimum width with exactly 
two digits to the right of the decimal point, rounding up to the nearest multiple of 
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">1/100</SPAN>. Answers within <SPAN CLASS="MATH">1/100</SPAN> of the correct rounded answer will be accepted.

<P>
Follow the format of the sample output.
